# Torch Arrow
This is a Minecraft Plugin for Bukkit/Paper/Spigot servers that adds a recipe
for Torch Arrows, special projectiles that can place torches where they land.
Very useful for exploring large caves or lighting up a countryside covered with mobs.

## Crafting and Use
As long as a player has the crafting recipe for torches, he/she can also see 
the recipe for Torch Arrows: one coal surrounded by four arrows. Fire these
projectiles from a Flame enchanted bow to place torches at long range.

Don't worry, Torch Arrows still work like regular arrows, so you can use them
to defend yourself from attacking mobs and players.
