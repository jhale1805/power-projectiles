# Power Projectiles
This is a Minecraft Plugin for Bukkit/Paper/Spigot servers that adds several new
super-powered projectiles.

## Crafting and Use
As long as a player has gotten the Enchanter advancement, he/she can also see 
the recipe for all Power Projectiles. Each projectile's lore (the text below its
name) contains instructions for how to use it.

Don't worry, Power Projectiles still work like regular projectiles, so you can
use them to defend yourself from attacking mobs and players.

### Explosive Arrows
Add a little extra bang to your shot with arrows that create a mini TNT explosion
upon impact! Requires a Flame enchanted bow to work.

### Forest Fire Arrows
Harness the power of the blaze rod to engulf your enemies in flames!
The Forest Fire Arrow uses a blaze rod instead of a stick and will start
a 3x3x3 fire around its impact site. No special enchantment required!

### Torch Arrows
Light up large caves or a dark countryside with Torch Arrows that place torches
where they land! Requires a Flame enchanted bow to work.
